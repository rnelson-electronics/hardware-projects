# MXR Distortion+ Clone

A recreation of the classic **MXR Distortion+**, an op-amp-based guitar distortion pedal using **germanium diode clipping** for warm, vintage overdrive characteristics.  
This version was redesigned in **KiCad** to practice schematic capture, PCB layout, and design-for-manufacture (DFM) techniques for analog effects circuits.
