# MXR Micro Amp Clone

A recreation of the MXR Micro Amp, a classic op-amp-based clean boost pedal.  
This version was redesigned in KiCad as a learning project to explore op-amp biasing, signal integrity, and compact PCB layout for analog circuits.

## Project Overview

- **Type:** Analog audio effect (clean boost)  
- **Category:** Classic guitar pedal practice project  
- **Software:** KiCad 9  
- **Fabrication:** JLCPCB (2-layer FR4 board)  
- **Status:** Awaiting PCB fabrication and assembly  

---

## Features

- Single op-amp gain stage with stable biasing  
- **True-bypass** footswitch wiring  
- **Input jack power isolation** for battery saving  
- Compact through-hole layout designed for enclosure integration  
- 9V DC operation with reverse-polarity protection
