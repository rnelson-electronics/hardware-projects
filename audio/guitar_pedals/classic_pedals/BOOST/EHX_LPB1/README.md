# EHX LPB-1 Clone

A recreation of the Electro-Harmonix LPB-1 (Linear Power Booster), a simple, single-transistor boost pedal, modified for **true-bypass** switching and **input jack power isolation**.  

This version was redesigned in KiCad to practice schematic capture, PCB layout, and design-for-manufacture (DFM) for small analog circuits.
