## Project Categories

### Guitar Projects

Collections related to analog guitar effects and circuitry:

- **[Classic Pedals](audio/guitar_pedals/classic_pedals/)** — Re-creations and layout practice for vintage effects such as the LPB-1, Micro Amp, and Distortion+.  
  Each project includes schematics, renders, and fabrication-ready layouts.

### Embedded Systems

Projects using microcontrollers such as Arduino or ESP32, these combine electronics, software, and mechanical integration.  


- **[Arduino Projects](embedded/arduino/)** — Interactive builds combining hardware control, lighting, and motion.  
  Current example: *Iron Man Mk3 Helmet* featuring servo control, LED sequencing, and sound playback.

## Learning Focus

- Practicing schematic capture and hierarchical design in KiCad  
- Refining PCB layout and routing for analog and embedded circuits  
- Applying DFM principles for cost-effective fabrication  
- Developing systematic documentation and project organization
